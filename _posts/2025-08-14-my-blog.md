# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my first blog post! In this post, I want to share a little about my journey in programming and data science.

I started learning Python a few years ago, and since then, I’ve explored web development, machine learning, and automation. One project I’m proud of is a **House Price Predictor** that uses machine learning to estimate home values based on various features.

In the coming weeks, I plan to write about:

- Tips for learning Python effectively
- Building interactive web apps with React
- Automating tasks using Python and APIs
- Exploring data science projects and competitions

I hope this blog becomes a place where I can document my learning and share useful insights with others. Stay tuned for more posts!
